* Things to moan about
- In defining Ax-Grothendieck formula I need sums indexed by
  n-variable monomials of degree at most d,
  this is hard since
  + If defined as a set I would have no access to the finiteness
  + If defined as a finset I can't take the sum because
    bounded_ring_term not a commutative monoid
  + so have to make a list consisting of the data of
    {f : fin n → ℕ | Sum f i = d}
